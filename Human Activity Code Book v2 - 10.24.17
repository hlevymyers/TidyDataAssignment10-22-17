Code Book
The goal of this combined data set is to make a very clean and tidy data set. 
The entire data set includes a READ ME file, a Code Book and a data frame, testingDF. The original data set included two data sets, test and train. Both data sets have been merged into one, testingDF, all linked by the same 563 column names, 561 variables, and two others columns. The first new column, SubjectID ranges from 1 to 30, one for each of the 30 subjects, that were 19 to 48 years old, and Activity, the second one, identifies six separate activities, walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, standing, sitting, and laying down performed by each subject. Each row measurement includes the subject id and activity name. The subjects performed these activities wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone attached to their waist. The data frames represent three different types of observations from the accelerometer and gyroscope in the smartphone, body acceleration measured in “g”s, or meters per second squared, m/seg2, total acceleration measured also measured in m/seg2 and the gyroscope measurements are in rad/seg. 
Several modifications have been made to the original data in order to make a tidier data set.  
1.	A column (562_SubjectID)  has been added to identify which subject performed each measurement. Previously this information was stored in a separate file. 
2.	A column (563_ Activity) was added to identify by descriptive name which of the six activities were being performed for the measurement. Previously this information was stored in two files – one to identify each row activity by number and another file to match the number to the specific named activity. 
3.	Several column names were the same although the data was different; therefore, the columns were not combined or eliminated which would remove data and possibly destroy the integrity of the data set, instead the column name was modified. For example, rows 303, 317, and 331 were all named “fBodyAcc-bandsEnergy()-1,8”. In order to have unique column names, necessary for extracting the mean and standard deviations, a column number was added to the beginning of the column name. The testingDF data frame now includes, 303_fBodyAcc-bandsEnergy()-1,8, 317_fBodyAcc-bandsEnergy()-1,8, and 331_fBodyAcc-bandsEnergy()-1,8. 
4.	For statistical purposes, the subject data was randomly divided into two separate categories, train and test. This created two separate data frames. These have now been combined into one data frame, testingDF, including all data. 

The mean and standard deviation were extracted from the testingDF data frame. 
A sample screen shot of the mean extraction is below.

A sample screen shot of the standard deviation extraction is below.

A second data frame, testing2, was created to compute the mean of each variable, by subject and activity. A sample screen shot showing the result is below.

A list of all the files in the original data set are included in the READ ME file.

The variables in the original dataset include 3-axial signals in the x, y, and z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
